# This is how I run configure.  You'll want to change the
# pathnames to match your system, of course.
#
# Note the CC=gcc must be set *before* the "configure" is ran.
# This is really needed, otherwise configure will not be able
# to compile the small test file which checks the presence
# of the MinGW build environment. It is *not* enough to use
# "--enable-gcc" configure option; you *need* to define CC.

export CC=gcc
sh ../configure --enable-threads --with-tcl=e:/tcl/win
